\thispagestyle{empty}

I would like to thank my adviser, prof. Nicolae Țăpuș for his advice and
encouragement during the crucial moments of my PhD. I would also like to express
my gratitude towards Mihai Chiroiu for setting me on this path and for his
steadfast supervision during the past 10 years of my studies, as well as Costin
Raiciu for introducing me to his research group and offering me his support.

I was lucky to have numerous friends and colleagues that listened to my endless
complaints and offered words of encouragement and advice. In no particular order:
Ștefan-Dan Ciocîrlan, Vlad Traistă-Popescu, Alexandru Mircea, Alexandru Văduva,
Emilian Rădoi, Vlad Bădoiu, Mihai Dumitru, Rareș Visalom, Cristi Dima and may others.

Here, I would like to single out Florin Stancu for always finding the time to
talk things through with me whenerver I hit a dead end during a research project,
and for helping me organize my first summer school.

Finally, I would like to thank my parents, Luiza Mantu and Florin Mantu for
trusting my decision to pursue a PhD and supporting me along the way.
